# hello-world
This is my first repository to learn how to use Github. 

My name is Eve. I am a developer at giffgaff and I love it. 

In my spare time I play sax for and manage [Lead Shot Hazard](http://www.leadshothazard.com). I also play sax in a new band that hasn't started gigging yet, and I'm studying grade 6 jazz. 

When I'm not playing sax or coding I can be found juggling/unicycling or playing Playstation. I love playing games like Fallout4, Skyrim, ESO, Mass Effect.
